# Summary
This is a mod in the vein of Vanilla+, adding new features and extensionso of the original game in a manner I believe to be consistent with Minecraft's own development philosophy.

## Key Features
### Dashing
You have the ability to dash. Enchantments can make you go further or higher, akin to a leap. A gui will let you know when you can dash. The frequency with which you can dash is dependent on your armor.
### Hearth
You can hearth to your bed anytime, so long as the ability is not on cooldown. This ability works cross-dimensions, and can be a real lifesaver.
### Weapon Variety
I've added a selection of weapons that have different damage, attack speed, and even entity reach! You can craft any one line of weapons you like, or have multiple on you for different situations.
### Portal Stones
Ever wanted to have a way to travel between bases? Now you can! With Portal Blocks and Portal Stones, you can travel to locations instantly. If you want to let your friend into your super secret base, a custom crafting recipe will let you copy an Attuned Portal Stone onto a regular Portal Stone.
### Quests
Ever wanted to get rewarded for all your hard work? Introducing the Quest Block and Quests! Once completed, Quest items can be used to grant you generous rewards!


## Origin
I built this mod originally for a group of friends I played with. We started out just wanting a dash ability, but then we expanded further and further.

I began to make new blocks, more abilities, and lots of artwork (that I am fairly proud of for a developer.)

Soon, we had enough cool features that my friends encouraged me to release it publicly. I am forever grateful for their support.
